## Installation

1. Clone or download:

Either clone this repository using Git or download it as a ZIP file and extract it to a local folder on your computer.

2. Open the Chrome Extensions page:

Open Google Chrome and go to the Extensions page by either typing chrome://extensions in the address bar or clicking on the three dots in the top right corner of the browser, selecting "More tools", and then "Extensions". There may also be a puzzle piece near the top right, then "Manage Extensions" at the bottom.

3. Enable Developer mode:

In the Extensions page, you should see a toggle switch labeled "Developer mode" in the top right corner. Make sure this toggle switch is turned on.

4. Load the extension:

After enabling Developer mode, you should see three buttons appear: "Load unpacked", "Pack extension", and "Update". Click on "Load unpacked".

5. Select the extension folder:

A file dialog will appear. Navigate to the folder where you cloned or extracted the GitHub repository in step 1, and select the folder containing the extension files. Click "Select" or "Open" to load the extension.

6. Confirm installation:

The extension should now appear in the list of installed extensions on the Extensions page. You may also see a confirmation dialog depending on the extension, asking for certain permissions or settings. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

7. Verify the extension:

Once installed, you should see a "C" icon appear in the Chrome toolbar or the Extensions toolbar. You can now use the extension as intended. 

### Extension permissions required:

- Read and write tab urls
- Modify tab groups
